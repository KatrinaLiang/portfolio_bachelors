This is an ePortfolio of Katrina Liang, student in Degree Programme in Information and Communication Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

This repository includes a collection of projects I have done during the first 2 years of my study at KTH:

- Network and communication: A clint server and a concurrent web server
