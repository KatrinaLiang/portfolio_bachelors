This is an ePortfolio of Katrina Liang, student in Degree Programme in Information and Communication Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

This repository includes some of the projects I have done during my bachelor's at KTH:

- A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in C. It is designed to be played on a PIC32 platform with a small display. 
- Network and communication: A clint server and a concurrent web server in Java.
- [An escape room game](https://mustafamusse.github.io/expo.html) developed in Unity.
